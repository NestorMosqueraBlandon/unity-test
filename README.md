# Unity3D and C# Test
This test is designed to test some advanced skills of the candidate in Unity3D and C# development.

Things this test is looking for in the candidate:

Speed: Prior knowledge to finish assignments in a timely manner.
Good practices: Within the same, I am looking for someone who can work with OOP and SOLID.
Basic knowledge of git.
That's it!

## Exercise:

Taking into account what you read above, create the following in Unity:

Create a project in Unity that has a repository on GitHub. Each functionality described below should go in its own branch which will be merged into the main branch once you are sure you have finished. When submitting this test, the repository should have all branches merged into the main branch and all branches described below should exist.

Branch name: "TUD-1"... In this branch, the necessary project configuration will be done. You must add 3 GameObjects, each one must be a 3D object of your preference (use simple things like a cube, a sphere, etc.). The idea of this branch is to have those 3 GameObjects side by side.

Branch name: "TUD-2"... In this branch, the required functionalities for this test will be developed:

Imagine you are trying to create a "Multiple Players Controller". The idea is that you can press a key and the 3 GameObjects execute the same task but with small variations.

When pressing the "SPACE" key, the 3 GameObjects must jump into the air (please use RigidBody to make it easier).

But each object will do something different when jumping: Looking from left to right...

GameObject 1 must rotate on any axis when "SPACE" is pressed.
GameObject 2 must change color when the "SPACE" key is pressed.
GameObject 3 must jump 2 times higher than GameObject 1 and GameObject 2.
